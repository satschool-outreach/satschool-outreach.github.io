        ### Welcome to the Biosphere module
        Learn how we use satellite data to measure the living parts of our planet.
        In this module you will learn about how we measure the biosphere from space using satellites.
        You will learn about
        * Electromagnetic spectrum
        * False colour composites
        * Forest fires

        This StoryMap aims to teach Earth Observation principles for monitoring the biosphere from space. We are going to cover
        * What is the biosphere?
        * What is a satellite?
        * Can we see the biosphere from space?
        * How can we use satellites to understand the biosphere?
        * A case study of forest fires
