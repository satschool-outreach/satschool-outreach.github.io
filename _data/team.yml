        **Co-founder of SatSchool | Chair**

        Biosphere Module Lead, Designer of SatSchool graphics and website

        #### Researcher profile:
        - Calum is a geographer and graphic designer who has followed his interests throughout his education and career to date;
        - He uses these skills to study changes in Arctic vegetation using satellite data, which has taken him to some amazing places;
        - He believes that if you work hard at the things you love doing, you will end up in the right place eventually - there’s many paths and none of them are ‘correct’ - you’ve just got to keep doing whatever is best for you!

        Intro to Earth Observation Module Lead
        #### Researcher profile:
        - Bryony came to work in the Earth Observation field from a Geography and GIS (Geographic Information Science) background, having done A Levels in Geography, Physics, Music and German - so a real mix!
        - She is now doing a PhD at the British Antarctic Survey, studying changes in the Antarctic ice sheet using data from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite (essentially a giant laser in space!).
        - She enjoys earth observation and is constantly amazed by the vast amount and quality of data collected by Earth Observation satellites and how it has revolutionised the ways in which we can monitor changes happening on our planet, which is more important than ever during the ongoing climate crisis.

        Cryosphere Module Lead   
        #### Researcher profile:
        - Morag came to work in the Earth Observation field from a Physics and Climate modeling background, having done Higher IB Maths Physics and Chemistry, by following her interests. This was not a career that was known to her at high school 
        - She is now doing a PhD at the University of Edinburgh, studying changes in the Arctic’s ice caps and glaciers using data from ESA's CryoSat-2 satellite.
        - She enjoys exploring the polar regions both in-person and through the data collected via earth observation. And finds her work extremely rewarding, providing insight into how polar regions are responding to climate change so as to be able to inform policy makers and the public on how we are affecting our planet.
