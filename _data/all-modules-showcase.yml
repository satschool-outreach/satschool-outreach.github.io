    subtitle: Earth observation outreach for schools
    description: |-
      SatSchool is an outreach programme for lower secondary school pupils to learn about Earth observation! The programme is designed and delivered by [**PhD students**](/team/) from the [**SENSE CDT**](https://eo-cdt.org/) and other institutions.

      You can find all the SatSchool modules [**here**](/Modules/All-Modules/). Each module is designed to be self-contained and can be completed in a single lesson. The modules are designed to be engaging and interactive, and to help pupils learn about the relevance of STEM subjects and the pathways to Earth observation careers.

      **Are you a teacher?** Check out our [**For Teachers**](/lesson_ready/teachers/overview/) page for more information on how to use the modules in your classroom with **lesson ready resources**.
