# What does SatSchool offer? 

### For Earth Observation Students / Researchers / Professionals
* Save time with 12+ hours of ready-made resources to use when conducting Earth Observation outreach in schools
* All resources are tailored to the Key Stage 3 / S1-3 curriculum, and were developed with consultation from specialist teachers
* A network of other EO ambassadors with experience conducting school visits 

### For Teachers / Educators 
* 12+ hours of freely-available resources and lesson plans to teach Earth Observation topics tailored to the Key Stage 3 / S1-3 curriculum (also applicable to KS4 and 5). 
* A network of Earth Observation ambassadors available to contact and arrange school visits. School visits can include:
  * An assembly-style talk
  * Cross-curricular classroom sessions covering a range of Earth Observation-related topics (see Modules page)
  * Sessions can run either for a particular class or year group, or as a longer enrichment day of activities
* Our Earth Observation ambassadors are currently based in Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool and Cambridge (but this network will hopefully expand!)
* A school visit from an Earth Observation ambassador will provide visible a role model for your students, who can open their eyes to environmental sciences and how a wide range of STEM subjects studied at school are relevant for a career in this field!  

# What does SatSchool teach? 

### Earth Observation and Environmental Science 
The SatSchool resources include six individual modules, spanning a range of topics in environmental science: 
* Introduction to Earth Observation 
* Hands on with Data 
* Cryosphere 
* Biosphere 
* Atmosphere
* Oceans 

*Discover the SatSchool resources on the [Modules](/Modules/) page*

# What is in each SatSchool module? 

Each SatSchool module contains 2 - 4 hours worth of presentations and interactive activities divided into 30-60 minute session plans.

### Module Structure
All modules are structured slightly differently, but contain:
* Slides for an introductory presentation
* Classroom session plans (each 30-60 minutes), including:
  * Interactive ArcGIS StoryMap collection that students can work through on their own screen (computer / tablets / phone) or that can be led through by a presenter on a single larger screen. Each single StoryMap in the collection is estimated to take around 30-60 minutes to work through and complete. Each collection can stand alone or they can be used together to explore and understand the wide range of Earth Observation applications.
  * Worksheet print-outs out for students to complete during the sessions (answers provided). 
  * Interactive web app (Hands on with Data module only) that allows students to run their own experiments with satellite data, including running some basic code.


## Equipment / Software Requirements 

### Software 
* No specialist software is required for any of the SatSchool resources. Everything can be accessed directly in the browser via the links on the [Modules](/Modules/) page.
* The majority of resources are presented as ArcGIS storymaps, which can be run in any web browser and include a mixture of text, images, video, interactive GIS, mapping and data analysis 


### Equipment
* As a minimum, a screen / projector is required for SatSchool resources to be presented from the front of a classroom. 
* If available, students can work through the SatSchool StoryMaps on individual screens (or in pairs/small groups) during the sessions. Computers / laptops / tablets would be most suitable, but the StoryMaps can also be viewed on a smartphone screen. 
* Worksheets are provided in the documentation folders of each module that can be printed out for students to complete in class or as homework when working through the SatSchool resources.
* Certain activities in each of the modules require some additional equipment, such as measuring scales or plastic cups, but these are all listed in the module documentation.
