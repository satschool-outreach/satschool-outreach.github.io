## New primary school reources

We have added two new primary school lessons to our website! These resources are designed to be taught to primary school age students, and include a lesson plan, presentation and worksheet. The ‘Introduction to Earth Observation’ module teaches students how city growth can be monitored from space. The ‘Wildlife from Space’ lesson explores the use of satellite imagery in studying animals. Stay tuned for our Gaelic lessons coming soon!
