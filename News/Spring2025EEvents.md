## Dynamic Earth Careers Showcase

On 10th & 11 March 2025, Leam Howe & Hannah Picton were joined by several fantastic volunteers at the Dynamic Earth Careers Showcase. Over 650 students from 9 different local authority areas were welcomed over the two days, giving us a great opportunity to engage with pupils, and teachers, about the SatSchool initiative. We were able to use our floor-mat showing a satellite image of the Bay of Naples to play 'I spy from the sky' , with many pupils leaving with a better understanding of the power of Earth Observation.

## Craigour Park School

On the 17th February 2025, Daisy, Lizzie, and Seonaid visited Craigour Park Primary School in Edinburgh. They had a brilliant time teaching the modules ‘An Introduction to EO’ and ‘Wildlife from Space’ , which aimed to inspire the students to think creatively about new ways that we can use Space to help Earth.

## Explore the Environment from Space Day

On the 3rd April 2025, Alex and Yvonne welcomed two groups of year 10 students to the University of Leeds to explore the environment from space! They began the day with an introduction to earth observation, followed by a tour of the university campus. The students then learned about how we monitor changes in the ocean through the 'warm and salty oceans' module and how we measure ozone through the 'atmosphere from space' module. The committee would like to thank Dr Heather Selley for organising the day and making it run smoothly!
